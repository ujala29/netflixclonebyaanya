This is a static HTML and CSS clone of the Netflix homepage. It’s a fun project to replicate the layout and style of Netflix’s web interface.

## 📦 Installation

### Steps to view the site:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `netflix.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
3. Enjoy browsing the Netflix-like homepage! 🎥🍿

## ⚙️ Usage

To use the Netflix clone, simply open the `netflix.html` file in a web browser. The page will render the Netflix homepage with various sections, movie posters, and styles, replicating the Netflix user interface.
